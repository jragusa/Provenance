Provenance analysis of the Voirons Flysch (Gurnigel nappe, Haute-Savoie, France)
=============

Regional settings
-------------

The Gurnigel nappe is located in the Prealps, reliefs spreaded between Geneva Lake and Thune Lake in Switzerland. Its paleogeographic location is debated : the main idea describes a south penninic location (Caron, 1976). However, recent biostratigrapic (Ospina-Ostios, 2013) studies indicate a north penninic affiliation, eventually the Valais domain (Tr√ºmpy, 2006)
